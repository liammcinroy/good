# terminal setup

theme of [ubuntu](ubuntu.terminal) from https://github.com/lysyi3m/macos-terminal-themes

just do a

```bash
open ubuntu.terminal
```

and then `toolbar -> shell -> use shell settings as default`.

for (bash) syntax highlighting is just:

```bash
brew install zsh-syntax-highlighting
source $(brew --prefix)/share/zsh-syntax-highlighting/zsh-syntax-highlighting.zsh
```

(with the latter line put in `.zshrc`)
