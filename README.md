# `good`
## _Liam McInroy_

This is a repo full of some code templates, prototypes, whatever, that I think
were either good, or useful, or I use often.

It's not particularly comprehensive, or organized, or anything. Just somewhere
to store all the things that I like.

## Contents

| Thing | Notes |
|-------|-------|
| [generic-conan](cpp/generic-conan) | Very basic `conan` build setup. |
| [gitignore](git/gitignore) | A `gitignore` I use often, probs too general. |
| [setup.py](py/setup.py) | Basic `setup.py` because they're all the same. |
| [tex/apa](tex/apa) | An APA formatted `tex` file. Very useful with cite. |
| [tex/book](tex/book) | The basic `tex` structure my senior thesis used. |
| [tex/notes](tex/notes) | A `tex` format for short notes. |
| [tex/string](tex/string) | A `tex` package for my weird string diagrams. |

much more to come...
